# BBX80
BBC BASIC for a Z80 home computer.

## General Information

In this repository you find BBC BASIC (Z80) implementation source code for a Z80 home computer that doesnâ€™t have a Disk OS like CP/M.

#### The system setup consists of three main blocks:
1. BBC BASIC (Z80) implementation from R.T. Russell
2. BBX80: general host and console functions
3. Host computer specific functions
  
#### Host computer minimum requirements:
* Z80 processor
* TMS9929A / 16K VRAM or compatible video out
* 16KB ROM or RAM for the bbx80 software
* 2K RAM
* Keyboard input function

## BIT90

#### ROM and Cartridge version of bbx80
The implemention is done for the bit90 computer, meaning you could replace the bit90 16K BASIC ROM (2x 8K) with the ROM version of bbx80 or you can load the cartridge version from tape or make a Coleco game cartridge with the cartridge ROM image. 
#### Original ROM BIOS usage
The Game ROM (Coleco compatible) is only used to start the system, the BIT90 ROM is not used or only to boot the system from tape. The Coleco ROM routines will still be avaible after boot, so you can call them from the inline assembler.
#### Features
Included are the core commands as in BBC BASIC Z80, without the CP/M OS commands. Additional commands: save/load to tape, plot, point, draw, move, keyson, keysoff, bye, colour, gcol and cload/csave via rs232. There is a branch table to extend basic and a mixed text/graphics screen with 50x24 characters, 256x192 pixels and 16 colors.   
#### Limitations
* I have tested the cartridge (i.e. tape) version on the real hardware and in the mame emulator, the ROM version is only tested in mame so far. 
* The save/load on tape worked in my configuration but your mileage may vary.  
* It is already amazing how much functionality can be squeezed into 16K of memory, extending the command set any further will require additional ROM or RAM for the system.

## Other / future plans

I intend to do another implementation for a rc2014ish computer, which is a more widely known. Other computers that easily meet the minimum requirements are MSX1, SC3000, SV-328 and Coleco Adam.
